Here is an example of Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/credit-check', methods=['POST'])
def perform_credit_check():
    # Retrieve applicant's credit score from a reliable credit bureau
    credit_score = request.json.get('credit_score')

    # Analyze applicant's financial history
    payment_history = request.json.get('payment_history')
    outstanding_debts = request.json.get('outstanding_debts')
    credit_utilization = request.json.get('credit_utilization')

    # Calculate creditworthiness score based on credit score and financial history
    creditworthiness_score = calculate_creditworthiness_score(credit_score, payment_history, outstanding_debts, credit_utilization)

    # Compare creditworthiness score against predetermined thresholds
    if creditworthiness_score >= 700:
        result = 'Approved'
    else:
        result = 'Rejected'

    # Generate report or summary of credit check results
    report = generate_credit_check_report(credit_score, payment_history, outstanding_debts, credit_utilization, creditworthiness_score, result)

    return jsonify({'result': result, 'report': report})

def calculate_creditworthiness_score(credit_score, payment_history, outstanding_debts, credit_utilization):
    # Perform calculations to determine creditworthiness score
    # You can define your own logic here based on the acceptance criteria

    # Example calculation: creditworthiness score = credit score + payment history - outstanding debts - credit utilization
    creditworthiness_score = credit_score + payment_history - outstanding_debts - credit_utilization

    return creditworthiness_score

def generate_credit_check_report(credit_score, payment_history, outstanding_debts, credit_utilization, creditworthiness_score, result):
    # Generate a report or summary of credit check results
    # You can format the report as per your requirements

    report = f"Credit Score: {credit_score}\n"
    report += f"Payment History: {payment_history}\n"
    report += f"Outstanding Debts: {outstanding_debts}\n"
    report += f"Credit Utilization: {credit_utilization}\n"
    report += f"Creditworthiness Score: {creditworthiness_score}\n"
    report += f"Result: {result}"

    return report

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single endpoint `/credit-check` that accepts a POST request. The request body should contain the applicant's credit score, payment history, outstanding debts, and credit utilization. The API then performs the credit check by calculating the creditworthiness score based on the provided data and compares it against a predetermined threshold. The result (approved or rejected) and a report summarizing the credit check results are returned as a JSON response.

Please note that the code provided is a basic example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements and integrate it with your existing system.
