Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the credit check and pre-qualification process for loan applicants:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/pre-qualification', methods=['POST'])
def pre_qualification():
    # Get applicant data from request
    data = request.get_json()

    # Perform credit check and pre-qualification process
    credit_score = data['credit_score']
    financial_history = data['financial_history']

    # Evaluate creditworthiness based on credit score and financial history
    if credit_score >= 700 and financial_history == 'clean':
        eligibility = True
        loan_amount = 100000
        interest_rate_range = (3.5, 5.0)
        explanation = 'Congratulations! You are pre-qualified for a loan.'
    else:
        eligibility = False
        loan_amount = 0
        interest_rate_range = (0, 0)
        explanation = 'Sorry, you do not meet the pre-qualification criteria.'

    # Prepare response
    response = {
        'eligibility': eligibility,
        'loan_amount': loan_amount,
        'interest_rate_range': interest_rate_range,
        'explanation': explanation
    }

    return jsonify(response)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single endpoint `/pre-qualification` that accepts a POST request containing applicant data in JSON format. It performs the credit check and pre-qualification process based on the provided credit score and financial history. The eligibility, loan amount, interest rate range, and explanation are then returned as a JSON response.

Please note that this is a simplified example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements and integrate it with your existing systems.
